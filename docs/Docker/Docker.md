This application comes with docker setup files, to ease initial setup and so that all developers can use the same development environment.
The main setup files (webserver config, PHP config, and docker compose) are located in the top level directory `/docker`. There is also a `Makefile` in the project root with some common commands to make it easier to start the docker containers and to create the database structure.

If you are using a Linux operating system (or WSL), there is [another project on my GitLab](https://gitlab.com/markbellingham/projects) that you can use to call the docker commands from wherever you are in Terminal, you don't need to reference the actual path of the project.
