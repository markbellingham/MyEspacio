Login is currently by invitation only. It is also only supported by the web interface. API requests may only `GET` data, they cannot run any `POST` or `PUT` commands.

## Login
Click the Login button at the top right. A modal appears where you can enter your email address. Submit the form and a message will be sent to your email with:
* A magic link that you can click and it will open the website and log you in - This is useful if you access your email on the same device as you are viewing the website.
* A 6 digit code that you can enter into the login modal - This is useful if you access your email on a different device to the one you are viewing the website on, for example you are viewing the website on a laptop but you receive email notifications on your phone.

The login magic link and code are only valid for 15 minutes. If the time between the user requesting a login link and them using it is longer than that the codes will expire and the user will need to request another one.

## Logout
Once you are logged in, the top right area changes to show your name and a logout button. Click the logout button to remove your session and log you out of the website.
